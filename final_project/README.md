## Architecture
### Use 3rdparty software
 Focus on application. Improve the efficiency of development.  
 Introduces Deep Learning Framework. Ex, Google Tensorflowand models.  
### Implement as Web App.
 Many various devices can be supported. PC, Tablet, Android, iOS  
 Prediction of deep learning requires a lot of computing power, however even smartphones have a GPU and can be used with WebGL  
 Easy to install. No installation procedure, just open page in Browser.  
 Easy to implement the responsive design
